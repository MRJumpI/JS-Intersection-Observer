# Intersection Observer! What is this?
The Intersection Observer API is a powerful and efficient way to track the visibility of elements within the viewport or a container element. It allows developers to execute functions when elements come into view or leave the view, providing an efficient way to handle lazy loading of images, infinite scrolling, reporting of ad viewability, and more.

Key Concepts
IntersectionObserver: The main interface used to create and manage an observer.
